### Project: [Ethereum classic](../projects/ethereum_classic.md)
### Date: 09 August 2017
## Summary
  Ethereum (ETH) client built specifically for the Ethereum Classic (ETC) community. It is the culmination of seven months of work by the Grothendieck Team, the IOHK developers dedicated to Ethereum Classic.
  
  There are three reasons for the client. First, IOHK wants to demonstrate that it has the technical competency and culture to be a leader for the development of ETC. Second, IOHK wants to dispel the myth that ETC is a “copy and paste” coin that uses other people’s code, and show that it is an independent and viable alternative to Ethereum. Third, the client is built in Scala, which is a functional programming language that offers security guarantees that other languages do not.
  This release is comprised of the four functional milestones working on since January.
* Blockchain download
* Transaction execution
* Command and query interface
* Mining integration
