## Summary
Earlier [this month](https://medium.com/iconominet/become-one-of-the-first-iconomi-digital-asset-array-managers-1a4f1779a97e) Iconomi had announced the opening of Digital Assets Management Platform and started receiving applications from individuals interested in being among the first Iconomi Digital Asset Array managers.
The purpose of the DAA platform is to create highly dynamic and secure infrastructure for the investors and DAA managers will help to reach this goal. Becoming a DAA manager at the early stage will enable participants to closely collaborate with the Iconomi team, 
thus helping to shape the future of the platform.   
The first Iconomi DAA manager will be Columbus Capital LTD, an asset management company specialising in global emerging markets and strategic investing in both traditional and alternative funds.
Columbus Capital, will manage Iconomi’s existing DAAs (ICNX and ICNP).
