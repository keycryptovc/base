## Summary
  WorldLink's validator will ensure the validity of transactions on the XRP Ledger and contribute to the robustness and long-term health of the network. The XRP Ledger has expanded to 55 validator nodes within its ecosystem, signaling growing strength and decentralization of its network and further mitigating the risk of a single point of failure. In addition to WorldLink, companies such as Microsoft, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and CGI are also validating transactions on the XRP Ledger.
