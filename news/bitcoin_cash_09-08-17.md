### Date: 09 August 2017
## Summary
* Bitcoin Cash eases mining difficulty. But still mining bitcoin is more profitable 
than mining Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash needs to reach approx. 550$ to be as profitable.
* Overstock (major retailer) now accepts various altcoins for payment, including Bitcoin Cash. 
Overstock customers can transact via Shapeshift’s native API easily using Bitcoin Cash, Dash, Monero, 
Litecoin, Ethereum, and more.
